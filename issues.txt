# netty DNS issue with MAC OS

fixed here: https://github.com/netty/netty/issues/11020

#
If you face error like "java.net.UnknownHostException: failed to resolve...." then add below property in your student and address microservices.
eureka.instance.hostname=localhost

# check this endpoint, why it's not working (feign client circuitbreaker actuators)
